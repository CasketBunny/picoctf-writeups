picoCTF - Mod 26
Category: General Skills
Difficulty: Easy

Challenge Description:
"Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is?"
The file mod26.txt contains the following encrypted string:
cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_jdJBFOXJ}

Solution:
The challenge title ("Mod 26") and the hint suggest it is a ROT13 cipher, a Caesar cipher with a rotation of 13 characters.
Applying ROT13 using an online ROT13 tool like rot13.com to the string yields:
